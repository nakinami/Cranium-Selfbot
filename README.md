<p>
cranium is a small project of mine that i wanted mostly for personal usage
<br>
it is coded in <a href=https://nodejs.org/en/>nodejs</a> and uses the <a href=https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris>eris discord api wrapper</a>
<br>
the bot requires <a href=https://nodejs.org/en/>nodejs</a> to be installed otherwise it wont install properly
</p>
<h2>installing</h2>
<p>
the bot can be installed by using the <code>install.bat</code> file, it will install all the necessary files to make it run
<br>
  once installed, you will need to input your <code>discord token</code> and <code>discord user id</code> into the config file that can be found in the now created config folder
<br>
once everything is installed and your credentials have been entered, you can run the bot with the <code>run.bat</code>
</p>
